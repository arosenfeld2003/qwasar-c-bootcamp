# qwasar-c-bootcamp

My implementation of several Linux and C libarary methods.
Some of these are rough (not refactored) and represent various stages of my proces learning to program in C.
As I began to get more comfortable with C and lower level programming, my work became more nuanced and a little more complex.
My_ls was one of the later projects completed.  As a learning exercise, I decided to use linked lists for storing, sorting (merge-sort), and then printing files.
